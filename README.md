## 🎯 Features

Uploader is an HTML5 file & image uploader widget for [Upload.io](https://upload.io/uploader): a powerful file uploading, file storage and file hosting platform.

You can use them together to:

- Add file uploads to your web app. (With zero configuration or infrastructure.)
- Serve files with minimal latency. (Worldwide CDN, 300+ locations.)
- Secure your files. (Optional: issue JWTs from your web app to define who can upload & download certain files.)
- Resize images, crop images & convert images.
- Extract image keywords & metadata.
- And much more, [explore Uploader](https://upload.io/uploader).
